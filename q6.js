/*In JavaScript, operators are classified based on the number of operands they act upon:

1. **Unary Operators:**
   - Operate on a single operand.
   - Example: `++` (increment), `--` (decrement), `!` (logical NOT).
   - Example usage:
     ```javascript
     let x = 5;
     x++;      // Increment: x is now 6
     ```

2. **Binary Operators:**
   - Operate on two operands.
   - Example: `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication).
   - Example usage:
     ```javascript
     let a = 10, b = 5;
     let sum = a + b;  // Addition: sum is now 15
     ```

3. **Ternary Operator:**
   - A single operator that takes three operands.
   - Often used for conditional expressions.
   - Syntax: `condition ? expr1 : expr2`.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     let age = 20;
     let status = (age >= 18) ? 'Adult' : 'Minor';
     // If age is 18 or older, status is 'Adult'; otherwise, it's 'Minor'.
     ```

Understanding these classifications helps in better grasping the role and usage of different operators in JavaScript.
